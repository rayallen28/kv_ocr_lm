kv_ocr_lm means extracting key-value pares from OCR results using language model, with one-shot method as additional inputs.
this project using paddleocr as ocr engine, using bert base multilingual as language model.
main process:
1. get all text blocks from ocr.
2. take wanted keys and one-shot examples for each keys.
3. loop all text blocks to find keys.
4. for each key, find all close text blocks close to key.
5. take each key-block for all blocks near key, using text classification task from bert model, find best matched pairs as final result.
